# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyse the employee data from the company Pewlett Hackard. Many of the employees were nearing retirement age, so I determined how many of the employees were set to retire. Then, I found the job titles of those retiring employees to determine which positions would need to be filled. Pewlett Hackward wanted to start a mentorship program between the retiring employees and new hires to ensure a smooth transition. Therefore, I created a new table to store all the employees eligible for the mentorship program.

### Data and Software
Using the data from the employees.csv, departments.csv, titles.csv, salaries.csv, dept_emp.csv, and dept_manager.csv, queried on pgAdmin 4.

## Results

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
